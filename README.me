YouTube Transcript Summarizer
A browser extension that extracts YouTube video transcripts and generates concise summaries using a custom LLM API. This extension automatically opens the transcript panel (supporting both English and Dutch UIs) and scrapes the transcript text before sending it for summarization.

Features:
Automated Transcript Extraction: Opens the transcript panel by clicking the "More actions" (or "Meer") button and then the "Show transcript" (or "Transcript tonen") button.
Robust DOM Scraping: Extracts transcript text using updated selectors based on YouTube's current DOM structure.
API Integration: Sends the extracted transcript to a custom LLM API (e.g., GPT) for generating concise video summaries.
Multilingual Support: Works with both English and Dutch YouTube interfaces.
